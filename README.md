# mu-edit
The most useless editor for modifying normal text files.

# Features:

 - Directly writing zeros and ones into that file!
 - Still easy to exit!
 
# Upcoming Features:
 - [ ] Writing to any file!
 - [ ] Opening any file!

# Building
This project uses `C++`. We use `cmake` to compile it. Here is an example how compiling the program would look like:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

The resulting binary is located in the `bin` folder.
